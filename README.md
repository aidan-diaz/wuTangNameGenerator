## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JS

This application allows the user to fill out a list of survey questions and generate a random name based on those answers. 


## Lessons Learned

This project taught me that by storing number values in each option from the select tag, I could add up the values of all of the selected items to dynamically generate a name based on user input.
